## How it works 
* Tap the big red button ("Select Folder") to select a folder
* You start rating the pictures with the buttons from ★☆☆☆☆ to ★★★★★
* The files get renamed as you rate 
* ☆☆☆☆☆ moves the picture to trash (undo possible during session)
* With ← →  you can go back and forth

## Features 
* ⭐ <b>Rating Overlay</b> - Hold any picture for half a second to toggle overlay mode. In this mode, your rating is displayed over the picture for one-sixth of a second after each rating. You can disable this feature for faster rating.
* 🗑️ <b>Delete 0 Star Pictures</b> - 0 Star Pictures are only deleted when you pause the app, close it, or press the button that takes you to the welcome screen. Until then, you can undo the ratings.
* ☕ <b>Contemplative Loading</b> - Our state-of-the-art image loading process takes just long enough for you to ponder the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. It's the perfect opportunity to grab a cup of <strike>coffee</strike> tea, contemplate your existence, or practice your patience. 
* 🙅 <b>No Second Guessing!</b> - The next time you start the app already rated pictures will not be shown.
